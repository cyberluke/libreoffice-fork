"""Lightweight synchronous event bus for inter-module communication.

Concurrency: ``emit`` copies the listener list under a lock, then calls
those callables **on the emitting thread** (often a worker). The lock is
not held while handlers run — that would deadlock the UI against workers
and would block two legitimate same-named events from different threads.
``subscribe`` during an emit is not in that fan-out. Snapshotting is not
UNO safety: a handler that touches Writer still belongs on the main
thread. Full rules on the ``EventBus`` class and
docs/framework/threading.md.

class EventBus:
    """Publish/subscribe event bus.

    All callbacks run synchronously on the calling thread. Exceptions in
    subscribers are logged but never propagated to the emitter.

    ``emit`` iterates a snapshot of the subscriber list so a concurrent
    ``subscribe`` append cannot skip/shift listeners mid-loop. There is no
    mutex across callbacks: a lock held while handlers run would deadlock
    UI vs workers and would serialize same-name emits that other threads
    are allowed to run. Handlers that touch UNO still belong on the main
    thread (see docs/framework/threading.md); a snapshot is not UNO safety.

    Re-entrant ``emit`` of the *same* event on the same thread is dropped
    (warning logged). That stops the sidebar config-refresh loop where
    ``config:changed`` → control ``setText`` → listener → ``set_config`` →
    ``config:changed`` for the same key. A nested change of a different key
    still runs. Nested *different* events still run. Concurrent
    emits of the same name on *other* threads are not dropped (thread-local
    dispatch set, not a process-wide lock).

    Usage::

        bus = EventBus()
        bus.subscribe("config:changed", my_callback)
        bus.emit("config:changed", key="mcp.port", value=9000)

    Weak references are supported to avoid preventing garbage collection
    of listener objects::

        bus.subscribe("document:closed", obj.on_close, weak=True)
