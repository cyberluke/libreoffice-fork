"""Callers that block the caller while a chat stream can still be running.

Speech-to-text transcription pumps the UI (``pump_idle=True``) so Stop and an
in-flight stream stay alive, and does not return until transcription finishes.
Notebook cells and ``=PROMPT()`` pass ``pump_idle=False``: the caller blocks,
and this wait must not return to the VCL loop. This is not the chat stream
drain. Re-exported from ``async_stream``.

    Run a blocking function in a background thread.

    When *pump_idle* is True (default), pump UNO events on the caller thread so
    the UI stays responsive (STT). When False, wait without
    ``processEventsToIdle`` — required for Calc ``=PROMPT()`` because pumping
    inside recalc re-enters the formula engine (``#VALUE!``), and for notebook
    cell execute because ``LayoutIdle`` livelocks on documents with many
    in-flow form controls. ``=PY()`` already avoids this helper for the recalc
    reason.

    *stop_checker* (notebook Stop): poll the queue with a short timeout and
    return via :class:`BlockingWaitStopped` when the predicate is true. Never
    pumps VCL for that poll — same LayoutIdle livelock as ``pump_idle=False``.

    This wait is not the chat stream drain. Do not turn it into the
    event-driven slice scheduler: ``pump_idle=False`` (notebook cells,
    ``=PROMPT()``) must not return to the VCL loop, and ``pump_idle=True``
    still has to block the caller until *func* returns.

    Never runs *func* on the caller thread: a missing Toolkit used to fall back
    to a synchronous call, which blocked recalc with no worker isolation.

    The internal queue uses :class:`BlockingPumpKind` as the first tuple
    element only (same contract as :class:`StreamQueueKind` for the stream drain).
