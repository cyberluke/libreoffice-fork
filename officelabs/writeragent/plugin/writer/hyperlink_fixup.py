"""Keep Writer outline-hyperlink targets in step with a search replace.

Discussion #819: a same-length ``setString`` inside ``replace_preserving_format``
keeps ``HyperLinkURL``, so a TOC entry whose visible title changed still points
at ``#old title|outline``. The HTML path's ``setString("")``, and a
length-changing preserve-format replace, can clear the property on the new
characters instead. Capture the URL before the edit and write it back after,
in both cases.

Bookmark targets (``#__RefHeading___Toc…``) do not embed the heading text.
They are left alone. Only URLs ending in ``|outline`` are rewritten, and only
when the matched text occurs once outside that suffix (or the caller passed
``hyperlink_url`` for that one outline link).

The write covers every portion in the paragraph that still has that same URL,
not only the replaced characters. A TOC link usually also covers the number,
the tab, and the page number; painting just the title splits one link into two
targets.

Discussion #819 follow-up: assigning ``HyperLinkURL`` on a *subrange* of an
already-linked line (the title only) splits that portion and LibreOffice
paints Internet-link defaults (navy + single underline) on the title and the
leftover punctuation/tab. Numbering and the page number are usually their
own portions, so a whole-portion URL write leaves them alone. A preserve-
format replace keeps the old URL on the whole line; the pending pass already
rewrites it. Skip the title-only paint when the replacement already has the
new URL. When a paint is still needed (HTML dropped the URL), snapshot
``CharColor`` / ``CharUnderline`` after the text replace and put them on the
same cursor immediately after the assignment.
