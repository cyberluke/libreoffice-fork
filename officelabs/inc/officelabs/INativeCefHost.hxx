/*
 * OfficeLabs INativeCefHost — platform isolation for the CEF sidebar host
 * window/view (mac port, Decision 5 of
 * ~/cef-spike/drafts/MAC_PORT_DESIGN.md).
 *
 * Every native ("Win32" on Windows, Cocoa on macOS) window operation that
 * WebViewPanel needs in order to embed a CEF browser inside the LO sidebar
 * is isolated behind this interface. WebViewPanel.cxx talks only to
 * INativeCefHost -- it never references HWND, NSView, or any other native
 * type directly.
 *
 *   Windows impl: WebViewPanelHostWin.cxx (today's Win32 code, moved
 *                 verbatim out of WebViewPanel.cxx; behavior-preserving).
 *   macOS impl:   WebViewPanelHostMac.mm (new; create/destroy/setBounds/
 *                 show/hide work, several ops are deliberate no-ops for now
 *                 -- see that file's header comment).
 *
 * Two members (setPanel, forceFrameRelayout) are additions beyond the
 * Decision 5 op list, needed to preserve behavior that predates this
 * refactor:
 *   - setPanel(): the host itself is per-frame persistent (owned by
 *     PerFrameCefState in WebViewPanel.cxx) and survives panel destroy/
 *     recreate across OLE in-place activation (chart/equation edit). Its
 *     "which WebViewPanel do I call back into" pointer must be rebindable,
 *     mirroring WebViewMessageHandler::setPanel() / WebViewCefClient::setPanel().
 *   - forceFrameRelayout(): the WebViewPanel constructor's "Option C"
 *     synthetic-resize kick (force the sidebar deck to re-layout once CEF
 *     attaches) is a native operation on the frame window, not the CEF host
 *     window, but it belongs alongside the other frame-touching ops here.
 * Both are flagged for Opus review.
